      <!-- A brief description of the singer -->

        Dominic Fike is a 28 year old singer, songwriter and musician from

      <!-- First section: how I found him -->
      <h2>How I found him</h2>
      <!-- Sharing how I discovered his music -->
      <p>
        Dominic Fike had been a feature on a Justin Bieber song in 2021, titled
        "Die For You" and the first time I heard it, I fell in love with his
        voice and got to googlin' right away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At this point, he had already established himself as a talented artist,
        but I had not heard of him. However, not only had he featured on a song
        with Justin Bieber, but he also did a feature on a song with Paul
        McCartney. Like, hello?? Sir Paul McCartney? A BEATLE? Talk about
        established.

      <!-- Section section: what I like -->
      <h2>What I like about him</h2>
      <!-- Sharing the reasons why I consider him my favourite -->
      <p>
        Dominic Fike seems like the type of person who really enjoys making
        music. As someone who loves music, I really appreciate when artists seem
        to enjoy what they do, rather than just using it as a way to make money.
        That being said, I think he has gotten so big now that his fanbase is
        becoming too much for him. He's not into the whole parasocial
        relationships that come along with a fanbase. Which is totally
        understandable.
        <br />

        Keeping that in mind, I try not to act like I know him. Cus I don't. But
        I do think he's <span class="fine">fiiiiiiiineeeeee</span>. &#128517;

        Oh, and he went to jail for assaulting a police officer, which I think
        is kind of funny. And now uses his following to raise money for The Bail
        Project which covers bail and pre-trial support for those who cannot
        afford it.

      <h2>My concert</h2>
      <!-- A brief description of the first time I saw Dominic Fike live -->
      <p>
        I got lucky enough to see him live in Baltimore in 2023. I was on a road
        trip and his concert lined up with my trip (more like the trip lined up
        with the concert) and it was so fun! Even though I was near the back, I
        still sang my heart out.

      <!-- Just a little joke about favourite songs -->
      <p>
        Honestly, choosing my favourite songs probably feels to some like
        choosing their favourite child. Like, you know there is one but they
        won't admit it. But I'll do my best to try.

      <!-- Section 5: music genre and latest album -->
      <h2>Music genre</h2>
      <p>
        I would call his music kind of alternative. At least in the early days.
        His most recent album, Sunburn, is maybe more of a soft rock album. But
        it is also my favourite.

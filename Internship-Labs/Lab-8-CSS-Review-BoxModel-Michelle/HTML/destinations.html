        <h2>My Favourite Travel Destinations</h2>
        <p>
          If you're curious about some of the places I really enjoyed, then
          you're in the right place! While I haven't been to a lot of places, I
          have been lucky enough to enjoy some really great places.

        <h3>Washington, DC</h3>
        <img src="../Images/washington.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Washington was really cool because all of the museums and the zoo were
          both free! I was actually only in Washington for a day, so I did half
          of the zoo and one wing of a museum. I could go there for a week and
          never be bored.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          I highly recommend Washington, DC if you're on a budget!

        <h3>New York City</h3>
        <img src="../Images/ny.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          While there is a LOT to do in New York, it is certainly not free.
          Depending on the kind of things you like, you'll never be bored, but
          may need to spend a little money.

        <h3>Malibu, Florida</h3>
        <img src="../Images/malibu.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          The beach? Impeccable. And free. I don't know if it really matters
          what beach you go to in Florida, they're all nice. And warm.

      <p>
        If you're bad at math but want to make sure you're tipping accurately,
        this is the page for you. Enter your bill amount before the tip, and the
        percentage you would like to tip (theoretically, based on the quality of
        service). The calculator will then tell you the tip amount separately,
        and then the total amount to pay with the tip included. You're welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bill amount: <input type="text" name="billAmount" id="billAmount" />

        Tip percentage: <input type="text" name="tipPercent" id="tipPercent" />

      <p class="standard">
        15% is standard for normal service. <br />20% is standard for excellent
        service. <br />Higher than 20% is considered to be top service.

        <h2>About the Band</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The Jonas Brothers are a group consisting of three brothers and formed
          a band in 2005. However, they gained more popularity through the
          Disney Channel when they starred in the movie Camp Rock in 2008.
        </p>
        <h3>Early career</h3>
        <p>
          The band's first song was recorded in 2005, and had considered the
          name Sons of Jonas, but ultimately settled on the Jonas Brothers. They
          were signed by Columbia Records and toured throughout the year with
          other popular names. The album was finally released in August 2006,
          and around that same time, the band recorded a theme song for a Disney
          Channel show, as well as multiple covers that gained popularity on the
          channel.
        </p>
        <h3>A New Label</h3>
        <p>
          The band switched labels in 2007 and signed with Hollywood Records.
          Their Disney careers continued, as they recorded a few commercials and
          were featured on multiple soundtracks. They went on to release a few
          more albums under this label, but continued working with Disney over
          the years, eventually coming out with their own show, Jonas (and a
          spin off).
        </p>
        <h3>Break Up</h3>
        <p>
          The band announced in 2013 that they were taking a hiatus, and
          pursuing individual projects. During this time, some of the members
          did release a few solo projects, but none gained the popularity that
          they did as a group.
        </p>
        <h3>Return</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, in 2019, the band reunited and put out an album titled
          Happiness Begins, and went on tour. Since then, they have continued
          their solo projects, but also make music together.

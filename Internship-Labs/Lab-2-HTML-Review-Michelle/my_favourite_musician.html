        <h2>About Dominic Fike</h2>
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Dominic Fike is a 28 year old singer, songwriter, and musician. He
          grew up in Naples, Florida, and has two younger siblings, Alex and
          Apple. He is black and Filipino. I guess you could also consider him
          an actor, because he was on a TV show, but it (and he) wasn't very
          good.
        </p>
        <blockquote>"Florida, bro. It's different."</blockquote>
        <h3>Musical career</h3>
        <p>
          Fike was part of a rap group when he was younger, but none of their
          songs have been officially released. Since deciding to release music by himself, he went on to release 2 EPs, 2 studio albums, and has been the feature on many other artists' songs.</p>


        <h3>Other interesting information</h3>
        <p>Fike was invited to perform at Coachella in 2023.</p>
  
       <p>He also had an acting gig on the show Euphoria, where he played the
          character Eliott. </p> 
          <p>He was also arrested and put on house arrest before the release of his first EP, and now uses his platform to raise awareness through The Bail Project.</p>

            <!-- description list -->
          <dt>Don't Forget About Me, Demos (EP)</dt> 
          <!-- defined term -->
          <dd>His first official release was an EP, which he released while on house
            arrest (more about that later). It gained so much popularity, that he
            started working on his first studio album as soon as he could. The EP
            was titled Don't Forget About Me, Demos.</dd>
            <!-- description -->

        <dt>What Could Possibly Go Wrong </dt>
        <dd>
                The first studio album was called What Could Possibly Go Wrong, which
                was released less than a year after the EP. From this, he gained even
                more popularity and went on to work with bigger musicians such as
                Justin Bieber and Paul McCartney.</dd>

       <dt>Sunburn</dt>
       <dd>His most recent album was released in 2023, titled Sunburn. While his
                    previous albums were more alternative and featured more heavy rap,
                    this album is considered more of a soft rock vibe.</dd>

       <dt>14 Minutes (EP) </dt>
       <dd>    He released another EP without announcing it in 2024, called 14
                        Minutes. The song Misses has been featured on a few trending charts.</dd>

      <!-- A brief description of the first time I saw Dominic Fike live -->
      <p>
        I got lucky enough to see him live in Baltimore in 2023. I was on a road
        trip and his concert lined up with my trip (more like the trip lined up
        with the concert) and it was so fun! Even though I was near the back, I
        still sang my heart out.

      <!-- Just a little joke about favourite songs -->
      <p>
        Honestly, choosing my favourite songs probably feels to some like
        choosing their favourite child. Like, you know there is one but they
        won't admit it. But I'll do my best to try.

            <h4>Sonic the Hedgehog</h4>
            <p>By: PnkPrncess22</p>
            <img src="../Images/sonic.jpg" alt="Sonic the Hedgehog cover" />

            <blockquote>
              This game is a classic. It's one of the first video games I ever
              played, and while they have improved upon graphics as the new
              versions release, there is something so nostalgic and comforting
              about playing the original. If I remember correctly, it was also a
              character that was created by a Sega user in a contest, which is
              really cool.

            />

            <blockquote>
              Being able to play on a team was fun, I have fond memories of
              playing with my brother. When he'd mess up, I would hit him
              in-game and then in real life.

            <h4>Disney's Aladdin</h4>
            <p>By: Nafis101</p>
            <img src="../Images/aladdin.png" alt="Aladdin game" />

            <blockquote>
              Aladdin is one of the best animated films and this game is just a
              fun way to navigate the world that they've made. It's a simple
              game, with easy to overcome targets but still a lot of fun.
